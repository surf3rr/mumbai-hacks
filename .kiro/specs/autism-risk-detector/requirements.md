# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The AI-Powered Early Autism Risk Detector is a web application designed to help parents and caregivers conduct preliminary autism risk screening for toddlers under 3 years of age. The application uses behavioral observation through video and audio analysis to provide early indicators that may suggest the need for professional evaluation. The system prioritizes privacy, accessibility, and clear guidance throughout the screening process.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: User Onboarding and Consent

**User Story:** As a parent or caregiver, I want to understand what the screening involves and provide informed consent, so that I can make an educated decision about proceeding with the assessment.

2. WHEN a user views the landing page THEN the system SHALL present detailed instructions about the screening process
3. WHEN a user wants to proceed THEN the system SHALL require explicit consent before starting the screening
4. WHEN a user provides consent THEN the system SHALL clearly explain data handling and privacy policies
5. IF a user does not provide consent THEN the system SHALL not allow access to screening features

### Requirement 2: Device Setup and Calibration

**User Story:** As a user, I want to ensure my camera and microphone are working properly, so that the screening can capture accurate behavioral data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user starts the screening THEN the system SHALL request camera and microphone permissions
2. WHEN permissions are granted THEN the system SHALL display a live camera preview
3. WHEN the camera is active THEN the system SHALL show audio level indicators to confirm microphone functionality
4. WHEN equipment check is complete THEN the system SHALL allow the user to proceed to assessment tasks
5. IF permissions are denied THEN the system SHALL display clear instructions on how to enable them
6. WHEN there are technical issues THEN the system SHALL provide troubleshooting guidance

### Requirement 3: Task A - Name Response Assessment

**User Story:** As a caregiver, I want to conduct a name response test, so that I can observe my child's response to their name being called.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Task A begins THEN the system SHALL display clear instructions for the name response test
2. WHEN recording starts THEN the system SHALL capture both video and audio for the specified duration
3. WHEN the task is active THEN the system SHALL provide visual cues and prompts for the caregiver
4. WHEN the recording is complete THEN the system SHALL confirm successful capture
5. WHEN there are recording issues THEN the system SHALL allow the user to retry the task
6. WHEN Task A is finished THEN the system SHALL automatically progress to the next task

### Requirement 4: Task B - Toy Interaction Observation

**User Story:** As a caregiver, I want to record my child's interaction with toys, so that behavioral patterns related to play and engagement can be observed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Task B begins THEN the system SHALL display instructions for toy interaction observation
2. WHEN recording starts THEN the system SHALL capture video and audio of the child's play behavior
3. WHEN the task is active THEN the system SHALL provide timing indicators and guidance prompts
4. WHEN the recording is complete THEN the system SHALL confirm successful capture
5. WHEN there are issues THEN the system SHALL provide retry options
6. WHEN Task B is finished THEN the system SHALL progress to the final task

### Requirement 5: Task C - Free Play Observation

**User Story:** As a caregiver, I want to record my child during free play, so that natural behavioral patterns can be observed without structured activities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Task C begins THEN the system SHALL display instructions for free play observation
2. WHEN recording starts THEN the system SHALL capture extended video and audio of natural play
3. WHEN the task is active THEN the system SHALL provide minimal interference with natural behavior
4. WHEN the recording is complete THEN the system SHALL confirm successful capture
5. WHEN there are issues THEN the system SHALL provide retry options
6. WHEN Task C is finished THEN the system SHALL progress to analysis and results

### Requirement 6: AI Analysis Simulation

**User Story:** As a user, I want the system to analyze the recorded behavioral data, so that I can receive preliminary risk assessment indicators.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN all tasks are complete THEN the system SHALL simulate AI analysis of behavioral patterns
2. WHEN analysis begins THEN the system SHALL display progress indicators and processing status
3. WHEN analyzing video data THEN the system SHALL simulate gaze tracking and facial expression analysis
4. WHEN analyzing audio data THEN the system SHALL simulate vocal pattern and response analysis
5. WHEN analysis is complete THEN the system SHALL generate behavioral flags and risk indicators
6. IF analysis fails THEN the system SHALL provide error handling and retry options

### Requirement 7: Results and Risk Assessment

**User Story:** As a caregiver, I want to receive clear, understandable results about potential autism risk indicators, so that I can make informed decisions about seeking professional evaluation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analysis is complete THEN the system SHALL display a comprehensive results page
2. WHEN showing results THEN the system SHALL present risk scores with clear visual indicators
3. WHEN displaying findings THEN the system SHALL highlight specific behavioral flags observed
4. WHEN presenting results THEN the system SHALL include clear disclaimers about the preliminary nature of the screening
5. WHEN results are available THEN the system SHALL provide recommendations for next steps
6. WHEN requested THEN the system SHALL allow users to download a summary report

### Requirement 8: Privacy and Data Handling

**User Story:** As a user, I want my family's data to be handled securely and privately, so that I can trust the application with sensitive information.

#### Acceptance Criteria
